/*A transaction in SQL Server is a sequential group of statements or queries to perform single or multiple tasks in a database. 
Each transaction may have single read, write, update, or delete operations or a combination of all these operations. 
Each transaction must happen two things in SQL Server:
Either all modification is successful when the transaction is committed.
Or, all modifications are undone when the transaction is rollback.
A transaction cannot be successful until all of the operations in the set are completed. It means that if any argument fails, the transaction operation will fail.
Each transaction begins with the first executable SQL statement and ends when it finds a commit or rollback, either explicitly or implicitly. 
It uses the COMMIT or ROLLBACK statements explicitly, as well as implicitly when a DDL statement is used.*/

--Transaction Properties-ACID Properties
/*Atomicity: This property ensures that all statements or operations included in the transaction must be performed successfully. 
Otherwise, the whole transaction will be aborted, and all operations are rolled back into their previous state when any operation is failed.
Consistency: This property ensures that the database changes state only when a transaction will be committed successfully. 
It is also responsible for protecting data from crashes.
Isolation: This property guarantees that all transactions are isolated from other transactions, meaning each operation in the transaction is operated independently. 
It also ensures that statements are transparent to each other.
Durability: This property guarantees that the result of committed transactions persists in the database permanently even if the system crashes or failed.*/

/*Transaction Modes in SQL Server
There are three different transaction modes that SQL Server can use:
Auto-commit Transaction Mode: It is the SQL Server's default transaction mode. 
It will evaluate each SQL statement as a transaction, and the results are committed or rolled back accordingly. 
Thus the successful statements are immediately committed, while the failed statements are immediately rolled back.
Implicit Transaction Mode. This mode allows SQL Server to begin the implicit transaction for each DML statement, 
but it explicitly requires the use of commit or rollback commands at the end of the statements.
Explicit Transaction Mode: This mode is defined by the user that allows us to identify a transaction's beginning and ending points exactly. 
It will automatically abort in case of a fatal error.
Transaction Control
The following are the commands used to control transactions:
BEGIN TRANSACTION: It is a command that indicates the beginning of each transaction.
COMMIT: It is a command used to save the changes permanently in the database.
ROLLBACK: It is a command used to cancel all modifications and goes into their previous state.
SAVEPOINT: This command creates points within groups of transactions that allow us to roll back only a portion of a transaction rather than the entire transaction.
RELEASE SAVEPOINT: It is used to remove an already existing SAVEPOINT.
SET TRANSACTION: This command gives a transaction a name, which can be used to make it read-only or read/write or assign it to a specific rollback segment.*/

--Example of COMMIT Transaction

/*The marked transaction is used to add a description to a specific transaction in the log files. 
We can use it as a recovery point in place of a date and time when restoring a database to a previous state.
We must know that the mark is added in the log files only when the marked transaction modifies the database. 
We can understand its concept using the following example.
Suppose we have modified the database accidently, and we don't know the exact moment of the data alteration; 
in that case, data recovery can take a long time. However, if we use the marked transactions, 
it can be a useful tool for determining the exact timing of data alterations.*/
